    <h1>Recipe for preparing and enjoying Banku!</h1>
    <p>Banku is a popular Ghanaian dish loved mainly by the Akan and the Ewe tribes.
        It's normally eaten as lunch or supper.
        It can be taken with Okro stew or soup, hot pepper, or even light soup.
        I really this dish because it's very delicious, especially with Okro stew.
        Another reason why I like Banku is that it keeps you going the whole day.
